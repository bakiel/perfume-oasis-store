# Cart and Hydration Issues - Fixed Summary

## Problems Identified and Resolved

### 1. **Duplicate Cart Store Implementations** ✅
- **Issue**: Two different cart stores existed:
  - `/hooks/use-cart.ts` (correct implementation with hydration)
  - `/lib/store/cart.ts` (duplicate without proper hydration)
- **Fix**: 
  - Removed `/lib/store/cart.ts`
  - Updated all imports to use `/hooks/use-cart.ts`

### 2. **Incorrect Import Methods** ✅
- **Issue**: Components were importing `useCartStore` instead of `useCart`
- **Fixed in**:
  - `components/shop/add-to-cart-button.tsx`
  - `components/shop/product-card.tsx`
  - `components/cart/cart-count.tsx`
  - `components/store/cart-sidebar.tsx`

### 3. **Missing Hydration Protection** ✅
- **Issue**: Components accessing localStorage without checking if client-side
- **Added hydration protection to**:
  - `AddToCartButton` - Added mounted state check
  - `ProductCard` - Added mounted state check and disabled buttons during SSR
  - `CartCount` - Already had protection

### 4. **Cart Sidebar Method Mismatches** ✅
- **Issue**: Cart sidebar was using wrong method names
- **Fixed**:
  - Changed `getTotalPrice()` to `getTotal()`
  - Updated import from duplicate store to correct store

### 5. **Wishlist Functionality** ✅
- **Added**: Proper wishlist functionality in product card
- **Created**: Wishlist page at `/app/(shop)/wishlist/page.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - LocalStorage persistence
  - Add/remove from wishlist
  - Wishlist page with cart integration

## How to Test

1. **Add to Cart**:
   ```bash
   # Visit any product page or products listing
   # Click the shopping bag icon or "Add to Cart" button
   # Should see toast notification
   # Cart count should update in header
   ```

2. **Cart Sidebar**:
   ```bash
   # Click cart icon in header
   # Should open sidebar with items
   # Can update quantities and remove items
   # Shows free shipping progress
   ```

3. **Wishlist**:
   ```bash
   # Click heart icon on any product
   # Should see toast notification
   # Visit /wishlist to see saved items
   # Can add wishlist items to cart
   ```

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Consolidated Cart Store (`/hooks/use-cart.ts`)
- Single source of truth for cart state
- Proper hydration handling with `hydrated` flag
- LocalStorage persistence
- Consistent interface across all components

### 2. Hydration Protection Pattern
```tsx
const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false)

useEffect(() => {
  setMounted(true)
}, [])

// Disable functionality until hydrated
if (!mounted) return null // or disabled state
```

### 3. Fixed Import Pattern
```tsx
// OLD (incorrect)
import { useCartStore } from '@/hooks/use-cart'
const addItem = useCartStore((state) => state.addItem)

// NEW (correct)
import { useCart } from '@/hooks/use-cart'
const { addItem } = useCart()
```

## Benefits

1. **No Hydration Errors**: Server and client render the same content
2. **Consistent Cart State**: All components use the same cart store
3. **Better UX**: Cart updates instantly across all components
4. **Wishlist Feature**: Users can save products for later
5. **Type Safety**: Consistent interfaces prevent runtime errors

- ✅ Add to cart functionality
- ✅ Cart sidebar with item management
- ✅ Cart persistence across page reloads
