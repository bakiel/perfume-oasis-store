# Perfume Oasis - Hydration Issues Resolved ✅

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. **Zustand Store Hydration**
- The cart store was causing hydration mismatches because it reads from localStorage
- Fixed by adding a `hydrated` flag to the store
- Created a `CartCount` component that handles mounting properly

### 2. **File Extension Issue**
- Fixed the invoice generator syntax error by renaming `.ts` to `.tsx`
- This allows JSX syntax in the file

### 3. **Component Updates**
- Updated `StoreHeader` to use the new `CartCount` component
- Updated `BottomNav` to use the new `CartCount` component
- Both components now handle hydration properly

## Current Status:
- ✅ Server running on http://localhost:3000
- ✅ No hydration errors
- ✅ Checkout flow working
- ✅ Cart functionality working
- ✅ PDF generation fixed

## Key Files Modified:
1. `/hooks/use-cart.ts` - Added hydration tracking
2. `/components/cart/cart-count.tsx` - New component for safe cart count display
3. `/components/store/header.tsx` - Updated to use CartCount
4. `/components/mobile/bottom-nav.tsx` - Updated to use CartCount
5. `/lib/pdf/invoice-generator.ts` → `.tsx` - Fixed file extension

## Testing:
- Visit http://localhost:3000/diagnostics to see hydration status
- Visit http://localhost:3000/status for system health check
- Visit http://localhost:3000/test-checkout to test the checkout flow

## Best Practices Applied:
1. Always check if component is mounted before accessing browser-only APIs
2. Use dedicated components for hydration-sensitive UI elements
3. Ensure file extensions match content (`.tsx` for JSX, `.ts` for pure TypeScript)
4. Track hydration state in Zustand stores that use persistence

The application is now running smoothly without hydration errors!
