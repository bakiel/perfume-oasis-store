# Ocean Breeze Product Not Found - Fix Applied

## Issue Summary
The checkout was failing with "ocean breeze not found" error because:
1. A product named "Ocean Breeze" exists in someone's cart (stored in browser localStorage)
2. This product does not exist in the database (may have been deleted or renamed)
3. The checkout process was trying to validate the product and failing

## Fix Applied

### 1. Improved Error Handling in Checkout
Updated `/app/api/checkout/route.ts` to:
- Provide clearer error messages when products are not found
- Rollback orders properly if validation fails
- Check for price changes to prevent outdated cart issues

### 2. Cart Validation Page Created
Created `/app/(shop)/cart/validate/page.tsx` which:
- Checks all cart items against the database
- Identifies unavailable products
- Detects price changes
- Allows users to clean up their cart

## How to Use Cart Validation

Users can visit `/cart/validate` to:
1. See which products are no longer available
2. Remove invalid items with one click
3. See any price changes
4. Clean up their cart before checkout

## Immediate Solution for Users

If a user encounters the "ocean breeze not found" error:

### Option 1: Clear Cart and Re-add Items
```javascript
// In browser console:
localStorage.removeItem('perfume-oasis-cart')
// Then refresh the page
```

### Option 2: Use Cart Validation
Direct them to: `https://yoursite.com/cart/validate`

### Option 3: Manually Remove Invalid Item
1. Go to cart page
2. Remove the "Ocean Breeze" product
3. Try checkout again

## Prevention

To prevent this in the future:
1. When deleting products from admin, consider checking if they exist in any active carts
2. Implement a scheduled job to clean up invalid cart items
3. Add cart validation before checkout automatically

## Database Check

No "Ocean Breeze" product exists in the database. Products similar to "breeze":
- None found

The product was likely deleted or never existed in the production database.
