## For Support Team

When a user reports "Ocean Breeze not found":
1. Explain that an old product is stuck in their cart
2. Direct them to `/cart-helper` 
3. Have them click "Clear Cart & Start Fresh"
4. They can then add current products to cart

## Root Cause
- "Ocean Breeze" product was in user's cart
- Product was removed from database
- Cart data persists in browser localStorage
- Checkout validates products and fails

## Prevention Added
- Checkout now validates cart before processing
- Error dialog shows option to remove invalid items
- Cart validation page available at `/cart/validate`
